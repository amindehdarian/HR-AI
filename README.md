# HR-AI
### *Applied AI & Machine Learning for Workforce Analytics*

This repository is a growing collection of **hands-on HR & Workforce Analytics projects** using modern AI/ML tools such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, LangChain, LlamaIndex, and Semantic Kernel.

The goal is to prototype and demonstrate **practical AI applications in HR**, including attrition prediction, absenteeism forecasting, policy Q&A assistants, survey analysis, and automated development-plan generation.
